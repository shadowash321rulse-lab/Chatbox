/**
 * Headset instance-roster reader (M2 hookup for the log parser).
 *
 * Tails VRChat's output log on disk, folds it with [VrcLogParser], enriches each
 * member's platform via [VrchatAuthManager.fetchUserInfo], and publishes a
 * [RosterUi] the Home `InstanceRosterPanel` observes.
 *
 * **Log access mirrors the reference companion (see docs/vrc-nexus-teardown.md
 * §4.7)** — it tries, in order:
 *   1. Direct File read of the candidate dirs (needs `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` /
 *      All-files access). VRChat's Quest package is `com.vrchat.VRChatAndroid`
 *      (legacy `com.vrchat.oculus.quest`); it also checks the shared
 *      `Documents/Logs`, `Documents/VRChat`, `VRChat/Logs` folders.
 *   2. **SAF** — a folder the user grants once via `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`,
 *      persisted + re-resolved from `getPersistedUriPermissions`. This is the
 *      route when `Android/data/<vrcpkg>` is blocked from the File API (Android
 *      11+), which it is on most Horizon OS versions.
 *
 * **VRChat must have Logging = FULL** (Settings → Debug) or the `OnPlayerJoined`
 * / `Joining` lines this reads are never written — the UI + Settings tell the
 * user this.
 *
 * Started ONLY on the headset build — the public/admin builds never call [start],
 * so `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` lives only in the headset manifest overlay.
